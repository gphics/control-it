    name: "aster yellows",
    description:
      "Aster yellows, plant disease, caused by a phytoplasma bacterium, affecting over 300 species of herbaceous broad-leafed plants. Aster yellows is found over much of the world wherever air temperatures do not persist much above 32 째C (90 째F). As its name implies, members of the family Asteraceae are vulnerable to infection, though the disease can also affect a variety of common vegetables, cereals, garden plants, and wild species.",
    symptoms:
      "Typical symptoms include yellowing (chlorosis) of young shoots, stiff and erect bunchy growth, greenish and distorted or dwarfed flowers, and general stunting or dwarfing. The phytoplasma lives in the phloem of infected plants and is transmitted by leafhopper insects when they feed on an infected plant and then on a healthy one. No transmission occurs through leafhopper eggs or plant seed. The phytoplasma is perpetuated in overwintering weed and crop plants, in propagative parts (bulbs, corms, tubers), and in leafhoppers in mild climates. The phytoplasma is destroyed in plants and leafhoppers subjected to temperatures of 38 to 42 째C (100 to 108 째F) for two to three weeks; thus, aster yellows is rare or unknown in many tropical regions.",
    control:
      "No treatment is available to save a plant infected with aster yellows. Aster yellows is best managed by removing infected plants from the garden to minimize spread. Management of the insect vector is not usually feasible in a home garden. ",

    name: "bacterial wilt",
    description:
      "Bacterial wilt is a complex of diseases that occur in plants such as Cucurbitaceae and Solanaceae (tomato, common bean,[1][2] etc.) and are caused by the pathogens Erwinia tracheiphila, a gram-negative bacterium, or Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv. flaccumfaciens, a gram-positive bacterium. Cucumber and melon plants are most susceptible, but squash, pumpkins, and gourds may also become infected.Bacterial wilts of tomato, Capsicum (pepper), Solanum ovigerum (eggplant), and Irish potato can be caused by (Burkholderiaceae) Ralstonia solanacearum.[3] Other bacteria in the family Burkholderiaceae can cause bacterial wilt of carnation. Bacteria in the genus Xanthomonas can cause banana bacterial wilt or bacterial wilt in the genus Agrostis.",
    symptoms:
      "Bacterial wilt is a disease of the vascular tissue. When a plant is infected, E. tracheiphila multiplies within the xylem, eventually causing mechanical blockage of the water transport system. The first sign of infection, which appears about five days after acquisition, is the wilting of individual leaves on a single stem. However, the disease will soon spread down the runner and then infect the whole plant, causing it to shrivel and die. There is a diagnostic test for bacterial wilt that can be done in the field. The presence of the E. tracheiphila causes the sap to become a milky color and acquire a sticky consistency. If the stem is cut near the crown and the ends are slowly pulled apart, the sap should form a viscous string",
    control:
      "Once a plant is infected, there is no way of stopping the spread of the disease. Some cucurbit cultivars are less susceptible than others, so it is beneficial to plant these cultivars. However, since wilt-resistant plants have not yet been developed, the most effective way to prevent the disease is to keep beetle populations at a minimum. While various methods of beetle control have been tested, the most effective preventative measure is to keep beetle populations as low as possible through careful field monitoring and insecticide sprays. Cultural control can also be effective, thus this means one should apply the direct method",

    description:
      "Blight is a rapid and complete chlorosis, browning, then death of plant tissues such as leaves, branches, twigs, or floral organs. Accordingly, many diseases that primarily exhibit this symptom are called blights",
    symptoms:
      "symptoms include sudden and severe yellowing, browning, spotting, withering, or dying of leaves, flowers, fruit, stems, or the entire plant. ",
    control:
      "Measures for controlling and preventing blights typically involve the destruction of the infected plant parts; use of disease-free seed or stock and resistant varieties; crop rotation; pruning and spacing of plants for better air circulation; controlling pests that carry the fungus from plant to plant; avoidance of overhead watering and working among wet plants; and, where needed, the application of fungicide or antibiotics. Proper sanitation is key to stop the spread of the infestation. For bacterial blights (e.g., fire blight), fixed copper or streptomycin is an effective antibiotic if applied weekly during damp weather when leaves and shoots are expanding.",

      " Symptoms include round-to-irregular sunken, swollen, flattened, cracked, discoloured, or dead areas on the stems (canes), twigs, limbs, or trunk. Cankers may enlarge and girdle a twig or branch, killing the foliage beyond it. They are most common on plants weakened by cold or drought stresses, insect injury, nutritional imbalances, nematodes, or root rot.",
    control:
      "Control includes removing diseased parts in dry weather; growing adapted or resistant varieties in warm well-drained fertile soil; avoiding overcrowding, overwatering, and mechanical wounds; treating bark and wood injuries promptly; controlling insect and rodent disease carriers; wrapping young trees to prevent sunscald; and keeping plants vigorous by the use of fertilizers.",

They include especially grape, members of the rose family (Rosaceae), shade and nut trees, many shrubs and vines, and perennial garden plants.",
    symptoms:
      " Symptoms include roundish rough-surfaced galls (woody tumourlike growths), several centimetres or more in diameter, usually at or near the soil line, on a graft site or bud union, or on roots and lower stems. The galls are at first cream-coloured or greenish and later turn brown or black. As the disease progresses, plants lose vigour and may eventually die.",
    control:
      "Crown gall can be avoided by using nursery stock free of suspicious bumps near the crown, former soil line, or graft union; practicing five-year rotation or avoiding replanting for that period; removing severely infected plants (including as many roots as possible); protecting against injury; keeping down weeds; controlling root-chewing insects and nematodes; cutting away large galls on trees; and disinfecting wounds.",

Rot diseases are characterized by plant decomposition and putrefaction. The decay may be hard, dry, spongy, watery, mushy, or slimy and may affect any plant part. Types include basal or bulb rot,gray mold rot, and root rot",
    symptoms:
      " Plants lose vigour, become stunted and yellow, and may wilt or die back and drop some leaves. They do not respond to fertilizer and water. Trees so affected die gradually; roots decay and may be covered with mold or black stringlike strands called rhizomorphs (Armillaria, Clitocybe). ",
    control:
      " rot can be avoided by growing disease-free plants and resistant varieties in well-drained, well-prepared soil with a high content of organic matter; rotating annuals and biennials; avoiding overcrowding and root or crown injury; maintaining vigour by proper fertilization, watering, pruning, and cultivation; and controlling rodents, insects, nematodes, and weeds. Seedbed drenches of fungicides are often beneficial for limited areas of flowers, shrubs, and trees. Soil for use in seedbeds and in pots can be sterilized by heating or by chemical treatment.",

    symptoms:

Other disease-prevention methods include planting resistant varieties or disease-free seeds, tubers, and corms; destroying diseased parts; removing weeds; rotating vegetables and flowers; and regularly spraying plants with fungicides, if appropriate.",
