    name: "curly top",
    description:
      "Curly top[1] is a viral disease that affects many crops. This disease causes plants to become smaller in size, have shriveled petals and leaves, and are twisted and pulled out of shape. They are often caused by curtoviruses (genus Curtovirus), members of the virus family Geminiviridae. This disease is important in western United States, such as California, Utah, Washington, and Idaho.Curly top is characterized by stunting of the plant and deformation of leaves and fruit. The petioles and blades of the leaves curl, twist, and become discolored.",
    symptoms:
      "Disease signs in young buds are curly, discolored leaves, yellow speckled, severe disease will cause buds to be sagged, trees are shortened, the ability to produce very few fruits, abnormal fruits and malt taste.Due to the pathogen's confinement within phloem tissues, necrosis, degeneration, and death of the periderm and phloem cells adjacent to sieve tubes ensue. Phloem necrosis also is easily observed as dark concentric rings or linear streaks in cross section or longitudinal section of the taproot, respectively.",
    control:
      "Because the disease is mainly harmful in the hot season, it is important to pay attention to increase the amount of water irrigated for the plants. This disease can be reduced if plants are planted in the shade because the beet leaf hoppers and other insects like to feed on these plants in the sun.Pay attention to soil handling carefully before planting trees. Plant density should not be too thick, pruning and sweeping leaves to destroy.",

    name: "Tobacco mosaic virus ",
    description:
      "Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus species in the genus Tobamovirus that infects a wide range of plants, especially tobacco and other members of the family Solanaceae. The infection causes characteristic patterns, such as mosaic-like mottling and discoloration on the leaves (hence the name). TMV was the first virus to be discovered. Although it was known from the late 19th century that a non-bacterial infectious disease was damaging tobacco crops, it was not until 1930 that the infectious agent was determined to be a virus. It is the first pathogen identified as a virus. The virus was crystallised by Wendell Meredith Stanley. It has a similar size to the largest synthetic molecule, known as PG5.",
    symptoms:
      "Like other plant pathogenic viruses, TMV has a very wide host range and has different effects depending on the host being infected. Tobacco mosaic virus has been known to cause a production loss for flue cured tobacco of up to two percent in North Carolina. It is known to infect members of nine plant families, and at least 125 individual species, including tobacco, tomato, pepper (all members of the Solanaceae), cucumbers, a number of ornamental flowers, and beans including Phaseolus vulgaris and Vigna unguiculata. There are many different strains. The first symptom of this virus disease is a light green coloration between the veins of young leaves. This is followed quickly by the development of a mosaic or mottled pattern of light and dark green areas in the leaves. Rugosity may also be seen where the infected plant leaves display small localized random wrinkles. These symptoms develop quickly and are more pronounced on younger leaves. Its infection does not result in plant death, but if infection occurs early in the season, plants are stunted. Lower leaves are subjected to mosaic burn especially during periods of hot and dry weather. In these cases, large dead areas develop in the leaves. This constitutes one of the most destructive phases of Tobacco mosaic virus infection. Infected leaves may be crinkled, puckered, or elongated. However, if TMV infects crops like grape and apple, it is almost symptomless. TMV is able to infect and complete its replication cycle in a plant pathogenic fungus,TMV is able to enter and replicate in cells of C. acutatum, C. clavatum, and C. theobromicola, which may not be an exception, although it has neither been found nor probably searched for in nature",
    control:
      "One of the common control methods for TMV is sanitation, which includes removing infected plants and washing hands in between each planting. Crop rotation should also be employed to avoid infected soil/seed beds for at least two years. As for any plant disease, looking for resistant strains against TMV may also be advised. Furthermore, the cross protection method can be administered, where the stronger strain of TMV infection is inhibited by infecting the host plant with a mild strain of TMV, similar to the effect of a vaccine.",

    name: "Citrus psorosis ophiovirus",
    description:
      "Psorosis, disease of Citrus plant species caused by several related viruses (family Ophioviridae). Given that the psorosis viruses are largely transmitted by bud grafts and not by natural vectors, the disease can have significant economic impacts on citrus crops grown from such grafts, including oranges, grapefruits, and tangerines. Severe infections can stunt growth, and fruit yields may be reduced by one-third or more.",
    symptoms:
      "Symptoms vary greatly and include formation in some young leaves of elongated, white to yellow-green flecks, spots, rings, or large translucent areas. Certain symptoms tend to fade as the leaves mature. Rings bordered by sunken grooves may form on the fruit. On trees 6 to 12 or more years old, the outer bark in localized areas commonly becomes scaly, or small irregular pustules and gumlike deposits develop, with the wood being stained underneath. Variously sized cavities or narrow grooves may develop in the large limbs and trunk.",
    control:
      "The disease may be controlled by removing seriously affected trees, planting psorosis-free stock, and using only scions and buds from virus-free trees. Quarantine and certification programs exist in many citrus-growing regions to reduce contaminated stock, though many Citrus species can harbour the viruses asymptomatically for more than 10 years.",

    name: "Banana bunchy top virus",
    description:
      "Banana bunchy top is a viral disease caused by a single-stranded DNA virus called the banana bunchy top virus (BBTV). It was first identified in Fiji in 1879, and has spread around the world since then.[1] Like many viruses, BBTV was named after the symptoms seen, where the infected plants are stunted and have 'bunchy' leaves at the top. The disease is transmitted from plant-to-plant in tropical regions of the world by aphids,[3] banana aphids which can also feed on Heliconia and flowering ginger (from the family Zingiberaceae), which is an important factor in control of the disease. There are no resistant varieties, so controlling the spread by vectors and plant materials are the only management methods.[1] Symptoms include spotting any deformed plant appearance",
    symptoms:
      "Banana bunchy top disease affects the banana fruit and foliage, and is caused by a single-strand DNA virus, the banana bunchy top virus. BBTV can infect species of the family Musaceae, which includes bananas, plantains, abaca, and more.[1] The aphids also feed on Heliconia and flowering ginger, which are grown in the same regions as bananas and must be considered in management of the disease. It is best to establish a banana production area where these alternate hosts are not present. Any age plants can be infected by this virus, but some varieties of banana, including the Cavendish, are more susceptible to the virus. In areas where the virus is less common, the disease is usually spread by planting diseased suckers at the beginning of the season, which means the season is started with a diseased crop. The pathogen causes cytopathological effects in the phloem tissue, which is the damaging of the host cells caused by the virus. The damage causes many effects that help to diagnose and characterize the disease. The name of the disease comes from the symptom which occurs in older plants, in which the new leaves that are produced are narrower than normal, yellow, and flat, which causes a “bunchy” appearance at the top of the tree.  If any fruit is produced, which is unusual, it will be deformed. In addition, one of the most distinctive symptoms is 'Morse code streaking' where the infected cells die and are lighter in color, causing irregular spots and dashes on the leaves that are easier to see when the waxy coating over the petiole is rubbed away",
    control:
      "There are no resistant varieties of banana against BBTV, so the most common method of control is chemical control of the aphid vectors.Another way to help control the virus is to remove and destroy any infected plants before the virus can spread, which is a practice known as roguing. Quarantines are also implemented to prevent the import of any potentially infected plant materials, including one in Hawaii that prevents the movement of anything except fruits from the island of Oahu to any other island, since BBTV is widespread in Oahu.Fruit is not often produced on infected plants, but if it is, the fruit will be deformed, which easily identifies if there is any virus present in the fruits to comply with quarantine regulations. Since bananas are not the only host, the alternate hosts for both the virus and the aphid must also be monitored for disease, and sprayed with pesticides to control the aphids more. When planting at the beginning of the season, the seed material or suckers should be obtained from BBTV free areas of the world or from cultures that are grown and developed to be free of the virus. Currently, there is ongoing research into biopriming, or inducing systemic resistance by using bacteria that live inside the host but do not infect.Control of banana bunchy top is achieved by killing the banana aphids then destroying all infected material. First, the aphids should be killed on the infected banana material, and then all the plant material should be destroyed to prevent the spread of the virus. Infected banana plants can be sprayed with an insecticide like Sevin to reduce or get rid of the aphid population, since control of viruses starts with control of the vectors. The agriculture department, however, recently obtained an EPA waiver for the pesticide Provado is a means of controlling the aphids that spread the disease.",
