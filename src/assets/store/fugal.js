    name: "Anthracnose",
    description:
      " a group of fungal diseases that affect a variety of plants in warm, humid areas. Shade trees such as sycamore, ash, oak, and maple are especially susceptible, though the disease is found in a number of plants, including grasses and annuals.",
    symptoms:
      "The causative fungi (usually Colletotrichum or Gloeosporium) characteristically produce spores in tiny, sunken, saucer-shaped fruiting bodies known as acervuli. Symptoms include sunken spots or lesions (blight) of various colours in leaves, stems, fruits, or flowers, and some infections form cankers on twigs and branches. The severity of the infection depends on both the causative agent and the infected species and can range from mere unsightliness to death.",
    control:
      "Anthracnose can be avoided by destroying diseased parts, using disease-free seed and disease-resistant varieties, applying fungicides, and controlling insects and mites that spread anthracnose fungi from plant to plant. For infections of annual plants, such as tomatoes or melons, crop rotation is suggested to limit the accumulation of fungal spores in the soil.",

    name: "black knot",
    description:
      "Black knot, serious and progressive fungal disease of wild and cultivated Prunus species in North America. Black knot is caused by the fungus Apiosporina morbosa (formerly Dibotryon morbosum), which can spread both sexually and asexually. Plums, cherries, apricots, chokecherries, and other species are all susceptible, and the disease can cause economic losses in untreated orchards.",
    symptoms:
      "The fungus initially infects twigs and branches, causing light brown swellings that turn velvety olive-green. As the disease progresses, these swellings form hard, rough, coal-black knots or galls that girdle and kill the affected parts. Older knots are often riddled with insects, and a severe infection can stunt and kill the tree.",
    control:
      "Black knot can be controlled by pruning infected parts during the winter (knots on large limbs are cut away, and the wound is treated), destroying nearby wild plums and cherries that may be affected, and spraying vegetative buds with a fungicide. Japanese plums are less susceptible than most American and European varieties.",

    name: "clubroot",
    description:
      "Clubroot, disease of plants of the mustard family (Brassicaceae) caused by the funguslike soil pathogen Plasmodiophora brassicae. The clubroot pathogen may survive in infested soil 10 years or more. The disease is spread from one area to another by diseased transplants, infested surface-drainage water, manure, crop refuse, and soil on shoes, tools, and equipment.",
    symptoms:
      "Affected plants are stunted and yellowed; they wilt during hot sunny days and partially recover at night. In the early stages roots are greatly distorted by a mass of small to large “clubs,” often spindle-like, but in a variety of shapes. Susceptible plants include broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, kohlrabi, mustard, radish, rape, turnip, honesty, rock cress, stock, sweet alyssum, shepherd’s purse, and winter cress.",
    control:
      "The disease can be avoided by using disease-free transplants, growing plants in clean soil and preventing contamination of such soil, applying, where feasible, large amounts of hydrated lime six or more weeks before planting, applying appropriate fungicides in the transplant water, and growing resistant varieties.",

    name: "Damping-off",
    description:
      "Damping-off, destructive disease of plant seedlings. Damping-off is caused by a number of seed- and soil-borne fungi and funguslike oomycetes, including Rhizoctonia solani, Aphanomyces cochlioides, and species of Pythium, Phytophthora, Botrytis, Fusarium, Cylindrocladium, Diplodia, Phoma, and Alternaria. Given the diversity of the pathogens, damping-off can affect a wide range of plant species and can cause losses for a number of economically important food crops.",
    symptoms:
      " sprouting seeds decay in soil and young seedlings rot before emergence; and postemergence, in which newly emerged seedlings suddenly wilt, collapse, and die from a soft rot at the soil line. Woody seedlings wilt and wither but remain upright; root decay often follows. Greatest losses occur in cold wet soils in which germination and emergence are slow, often in indoor conditions.",
    control:
      "Damping-off can be avoided by starting seed in light, well-drained, well-prepared soil or sterile mix (containing perlite, peat moss, or vermiculite); treating soil with steam, dry heat or a fumigant; avoiding overcrowding, excessive shade, overwatering, too deep planting, and overfertilizing; and sowing crack-free, healthy seed dusted with fungicide seed protectant. An early outbreak can be controlled by applying a fungicide solution.",

    name: "Dutch elm disease",
    description:
      "Dutch elm disease, widespread fungoid killer of elms (Ulmus species) and certain other trees, first described in the Netherlands. Spread by bark beetles, the disease has decimated elm populations throughout much of Europe and North America. Dutch elm disease is caused by three species of ascomycete fungi in the genus Ophiostoma. One of these, O. ulmi (also known as Ceratocystis ulmi), was probably introduced into Europe from Asia during World War I. The disease was first identified in the United States in 1930. A federal eradication campaign in the late 1930s and early 40s sharply reduced the numbers of infected elms but could not stop the diseases spread into regions wherever the very susceptible American elm (Ulmus americana) grows. In the late 1940s, another virulent species, O. novo-ulmi, was described in Europe and the United States, and heavy elm losses continued. This species was introduced to Auckland, New Zealand, in 1989, where it was nearly eradicated with aggressive control measures; the country suffered a major outbreak in 2013 due to a decline in funding for these efforts. The third species, O. himal-ulmi, was discovered in 1993 and is endemic to the Himalayas.",
    symptoms:
      "The leaves on one or more branches of a stricken tree suddenly wilt, turn dull green to yellow or brown, curl, and may drop early. Young, rapidly growing elms may die in one to two months; older or less vigorous trees sometimes take two years or more to succumb. A brown to black discoloration occurs in the white sapwood of wilting branches just under the bark. Because symptoms are easily confused with other diseases, especially elm phloem necrosis and diebacks, positive diagnosis is only possible through laboratory culturing.",
    control:
      "The control of Dutch elm disease largely involves the exclusion of beetles. All dead, weak, or dying elm wood with tight bark should be burned, debarked, or buried before elms leaf out in early spring. A single, annual dormant spray that coats all bark surfaces with long-lasting insecticide (e.g., methoxychlor) can kill many beetles before they deposit fungus spores. Claims of fungal control have been made for certain fungicides that are injected into the sapwood. Such measures appear to be more protective than curative. Although other species of elms, as well as species of the related Zelkova and Planera, are susceptible in varying degrees, the smooth leaf (Ulmus carpinifolia), Chinese (U. parvifolia), and Siberian (U. pumila) elms have shown good resistance, and experiments with hybrids of American and Asiatic elms have met with much success.",

    name: "Ergot",
    description:
      "Ergot, fungal disease of cereal grasses, especially rye, caused by species of the ascomycete fungus Claviceps. The disease decreases the production of viable grains by infected plants and can contaminate harvests. Ergot is commonly associated with rye infected by C. purpurea, but other economically important cereals are also susceptible to the disease by other fungal species. For example, ergot of sorghum is caused by C. africana, while that of pearl millet is due to C. fusiformis.",
    symptoms:
      "The wind carries the fungal spores of ergot to the flowers of susceptible grasses, where the spores germinate, infect, and destroy the ovaries of the plant. In an ear of rye infected with ergot, a sweet, yellowish mucus is exuded for a time, followed by a loss of starch as the ear ceases growth. The ovaries then become permeated by the mycelium, a mass of fungal filaments, which in autumn forms the spur-like purple-black sclerotium. The sclerotia, commonly called ergot, are shaped like grain kernels but are considerably larger and contain a number of poisonous alkaloids. A mature head of grain may carry several ergots in addition to noninfected kernels, and, although most ergots fall to the ground during harvest, some remain on the plants and are mixed with the grain. The ergots remaining on the ground overwinter and produce tiny black mushroom-shaped bodies that expel large numbers of spores in the spring, thus starting a new series of infections.",
    control:
      "Ensure uniform stands - Use seed with good germination, seed at a consistent depth, and use a balanced fertilizer program so that the cereal crop is uniform in development. The addition of copper will also help control ergot infection, but only in copper deficient soils.",
